This folder is dedicated to translation efforts for Project SAYA and the Emotionics framework.

We currently prioritize the following seven languages due to their strategic and cultural significance:

- English  
- French  
- Russian  
- Arabic  
- Chinese (Simplified)  
- Spanish  
- Hindi  

Translations into these languages are preferred to ensure broader reach and future integration within potential global governance structures.

Contributors are welcome to add other languages as well, but these seven are our initial focus.

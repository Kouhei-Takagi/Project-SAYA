# Contributors

This folder is reserved for those who have meaningfully contributed to the evolution of Project SAYA or the Emotionics framework â€” through code, ideas, translations, diagrams, or resonance.

In the spirit of open exploration and quiet collaboration, contributions are acknowledged here not by formal authority, but through recognition of intent and care.

- Developed new emotional formulas

This is a garden of footprints.

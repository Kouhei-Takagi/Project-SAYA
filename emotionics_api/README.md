## Emotionics Analyzer – Demonstration Video

This video demonstrates the macOS Emotionics Analyzer, a research-oriented tool
that performs Emotionics-based analysis on free-text input.

The demo shows:
- A real-time Emotionics-based analysis pipeline
- Structured interpretation of emotional signals
- JSON-formatted outputs for research use
- A simple and reproducible workflow for developers

Emotionics aims to provide a structured framework to analyze emotional states
and reactions through a computational model.

## Emotionics Analyzer – Demonstration Video

This video demonstrates the macOS Emotionics Analyzer, a tool that performs
emotion extraction and Emotionics-based interpretation from free-text input.

The demo shows:
- Real-time analysis using the EmotionicsAPI
- Extraction of expressed, felt, and feigned emotional distributions
- JSON-formatted results based on the Emotionics Periodic Table
- A simple and reproducible workflow for researchers and developers

Emotionics aims to provide a structured framework to analyze human emotions,
emotional reactions, and hidden emotional layers through a computational model.

🌈 Emotional Periodic Table 3.0

A structured emotional taxonomy for AI, researchers, and future AGI systems

This repository contains the Emotional Periodic Table 3.0 (EPT3.0) —
a structured, chemical-like emotional taxonomy designed for:
	•	Emotionics research
	•	AI and AGI emotional modeling
	•	Game theory × emotion analysis
	•	Social system design (BPS framework)
	•	Psychological visualization and knowledge graphs

EPT3.0 defines 64 emotional elements, grouped by
Valence / Activation / Social direction, and provides both:
	•	A visual diagram (images/periodic-table3.png)
	•	A machine-readable JSON dataset (periodic-table3.json)

📦 Folder Structure

💡 What is Emotionics?

Emotionics is an emerging framework that analyzes human emotions
using concepts inspired by:
	•	Chemistry (elements / reactions / catalysts)
	•	Information flow
	•	Psychology
	•	Social dynamics
	•	Behavioral economics

Emotionics aims to provide a precise, structured language for emotions,
suitable for both humans and artificial intelligence.

EPT3.0 represents the “element table” of this system —
analogous to the periodic table of chemistry.

📘 About Emotional Periodic Table 3.0

Each emotional element in EPT3.0 includes:
	•	Name
    •	Symbol (e.g., Cm = Comfortable)
	•	row
    •	col
	•	group
	•	relations

The full dataset is available in
periodic-table3.json.

🧪 Use Cases
This dataset can be used for:

✔ AI / AGI Training

Emotion classification, RLHF, multi-modal alignment.

✔ Research

Behavioral psychology, computational social science.

✔ Market / Geopolitical Emotion Analysis

(Based on Emotionics Verb–State model)

✔ Game Theory & Strategy Modeling

Integrating emotion as a formal variable.

✔ App & Software Development
Emotion-aware UX, recommender systems, wellbeing apps.


🔧 Future Extensions
The schema/ folder is reserved for:
	•	JSON schema
	•	OpenAPI definitions
	•	Mapping matrices (reaction, transition, catalyst tables)
	•	EPT4.0 previews
